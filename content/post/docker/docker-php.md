In this note I'm going to assume you know how to at least setup Docker. This is going to cover how to run php in a Docker container localy. If you want to know how to get started with docker. Click here "intro-to-docker"

I'll be going through this youtube video tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SddXBkP200 . So credit for the lesson goes to Will it Scale.

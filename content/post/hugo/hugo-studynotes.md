## Creating a new site
Creating all the folders manual would be a huge pain. So we use the command `hugo new site [site name]`

In order to create a website called hello-world we would use the command `hugo new site hello-world`



## Creating & Organizing Content
to create a new file type command 'hugo new [path]/[filename]' so example is hugo new a.md
or even 'hugo new folder1/file1.md'

to get it to run to see your site in dev mode. 
use the commmand 'hugo server -D'

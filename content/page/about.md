Hello World! My name is Paul. When I was 2 years old I told my mom "Mom, I want to be a artist". Fast forward 30 years and I have ended up as a front-end Developer and have been breaking code since 2006.

I have mostly focused on the front-end and loved learning how far I could push the limits of CSS and building things that are normaly done in javascript. 

I enjoy learning new technologies and experimenting with new languages. 

Recently I have been bitten by the automation bug and have started playing around with python and Go.
